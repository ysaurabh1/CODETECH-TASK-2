Objective:This project is designed to manage student records in an educational setting. It involves creating a relational database to store and organize data about students, courses, and enrollments. The database allows the management of student information, the courses they are enrolled in, and their grades. By using SQL queries, this project helps in querying and manipulating data efficiently.

Features:
 1)Student Management:
             ..Store personal details of students (e.g., name, gender, contact details, and address).
             ..Provide easy access to student records for administration and reporting.

2)Course Management:
             ..Maintain a list of courses offered, including course codes and descriptions.
             ..Enable easy addition and modification of course details.
3)Enrollment System:
             ..Track which students are enrolled in which courses.
             ..Store grades for students in each course they are enrolled in.
4)Data Integrity:
             ..Use primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between students, courses, and enrollments.
             ..Ensure data consistency and avoid redundancy.
5)Queries for Data Retrieval:
            ..Simple queries to retrieve student information, course details, and grades.
            ..Advanced queries to analyze student performance, course popularity, and more.
Key Points:

a)Relational Database: The project uses a relational database system with three key tables: Students, Courses, and Enrollments.
b)Normalization: The database is normalized to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
c)SQL Queries: Various SQL queries are used to manage, retrieve, and analyze data, from simple selections to complex joins and aggregations.
d)Scalability: The system can handle more students, courses, and enrollments, with easy updates and modifications.
f)User-friendly: Allows easy querying to fetch data, such as finding students enrolled in a specific course, retrieving the highest grade in a course, or listing students not enrolled in any courses.
